# RSS Feed
 A basic RSS Feed reader takes a RSS URL then displays the headlines with links to the articles

## Installation
Copy the rssfeed.php file onto a server running PHP then in a browser navigate to the rssfeed.php file to view a demo of its usage.

## Usage
Enter an RSS URL in the input field to view the formatted RSS feed.

Example RSS URL's -
http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml
https://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index
https://www.nytimes.com/svc/collections/v1/publish/https://www.nytimes.com/section/world/rss.xml
